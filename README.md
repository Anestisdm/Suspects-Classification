# Suspects Classification

### 1 - Scope
The purpose of this project is to implement a classification algorithm with a Randomized Binary Search Tree so that it can be used to find the top suspects from a list of people
based on financial data.

### 2 - Application
The Italian government has decided to make more arrests of suspects after the night falls in Palermo, Sicily. However, because it is difficult to find evidence of murder, theft, etc., has decided to turn to the financial data of suspects who are not justified by their jobs. First of all, a systematic process of registering suspected Italian depositors abroad will begin (in cooperation with the authorities of Switzerland and other countries). However,in order to do this, an application with an efficient data structure needed to be implemented where all the suspects will be registered there.

### 3 - Features
* Insert Suspects in the application 
* Load Suspects in the application
* Update Savings of Suspects
* Search for Suspects in the application
* Remove Suspects from application
* Get Mean Savings of Suspects
* Print Top Suspects
