# Suspects Classification

### 1 - Scope
The purpose of this project is to implement a classification algorithm with a Randomized Binary Search Tree so that it can be used to find the top suspects from a list of people based on financial data.

### 2 - Application
The Italian government has decided to make more arrests of suspects after the night falls in Palermo, Sicily. However, because it is difficult to find evidence of murder, theft, etc., has decided to turn to the financial data of suspects who are not justified by their jobs. First of all, a systematic process of registering suspected Italian depositors abroad will begin (in cooperation with the authorities of Switzerland and other countries). However, in order to do this, an application with an efficient data structure needed to be implemented where all the suspects will be registered there. This application implements a Randomized Binary Search Tree which classifies the suspicious depositors based on their financial data.

### 3 - Features
* Insert Suspects in the application manually
* Load Suspects in the application via text file 
* Update Savings of Suspects
* Search for Suspects in the application
* Remove Suspects from application
* Get Mean Savings of Suspects
* Print Top Suspects
* Print Suspects classified by Tax Identification Number

### 4 - How it works

**Workstation Specifications**
- Windows 10 or Linux or MacOS, 64 bit
- RAM, 8GB required
- 128 GB Storage 
- 4 Core CPU

**Steps to run the application**
1. Clone this repository to Intellij
2. Run 'RandomizedBST_Main' from Intellij
3. Start using the application and all the features from UI that appears

Tip: Insert manually or Load via text file suspects first so you can use all the features of the application (text file need to be stored in the folder 'data')
